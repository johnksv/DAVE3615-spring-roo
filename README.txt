Assignment 1: Book store - Spring ROO
DAVE3615 - Software Architecture and Frameworks
By: John Kasper Svergja - s305089

To launch:
Unpack the zip to a destination of you choice.
Open a terminal in the directory
In the terminal run "mvn package tomcat7:run" (without quotes)
The application is now available at http://localhost:8080/bookstore

Troubleshoot:
Check that port 8080 is available if you can't access the application.


Features:
CRUD of the entities.
Email to contact "customer service".
Logging.
Possible to upload image with each book.

Please see:
A time factor calendar was included for the books entity (as the assignment requested), even though it is unused.
I was unsure with the meaning of step 6. I interpreted it as all roo specific files (.aj-files) were ment to be removed. I did this via the push-in refactoring feature in the spring tool suite. Roo annotations is left in case I want to use roo again in this project.
